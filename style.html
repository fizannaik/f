tea is what I love the most, Many of them say it affects the health, but for me it's my stress-relief medicine. <br>
They say sugar free, black tea, green tea should be taken instead of tea , but The relief or happiness I get by having tea cannot be bargained by those green tea and bla bla.
<p>Inshort TEA is luv,TEA is everything for me<br><span>

PANHALA FORT, KOLHAPUR.<br>
The rainy day I experienced I spent on Panhala.
<p>It was just an ordinary day, my friend called me and asked me to go on a ride. So we went on Panhala for an day to spent.
That was th first time we saw such beautiful sceneary.</p>
<p>the clouds touching to ground through water droplets, and the smell of sand was just mesmerising for us.</p></p>
